			Beautiful Quotes
		</div>
		<p>
			We all hit road blocks sometimes. That’s why you got to have a stack of good quotes that will help you remember why you started what you are working on in the first place.

Here are some inspiring and hilarious quotations from amazing designers that are sure to help any productivity or inspiration block! <q></q>Intuitive design is how we give the user new superpowers.</q> &nbsp;<q>The public is more familiar with bad design than good design. It is, in effect, conditioned to prefer bad design, because that is what it lives with. The new becomes threatening, the old reassuring.</q> – Paul Rand  &nbsp;<q> If there’s one thing you learn by working on a lot of different Web sites, it’s that almost any design idea–no matter how appallingly bad–can be made usable in the right circumstances, with enough effort.  ― Steve Krug</q> “Create your own visual style… let it be unique for yourself and yet identifiable for others.” – Orson Welles “A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.” –Antoine de Saint-Exupéry “Design is a plan for arranging elements in such a way as best to accomplish a particular purpose.” – Charles Eames
